<img align="left" width="33%" src="/assets/img/jonasNY.png"> Welcome to my personal space, where you can find the latest information about my professional development, recent work, and occasional blog-posts. If you are as excited about ***Machine Learning***, ***Data Mining***, ***Computational Biology***, and how they connect, please reach out! I am particularly interested in the Interpretability of complex ML models, unraveling what they actually learn, and how this helps us to investigate (un)fairness of these models. Ultimately, I am interested in how we can design interpretable and fair models for biomedical research, suited for clinical practice.
